# Data_Projects
A repository for a variety of data science projects and files

This repository serves as a sort of "catch-all" for my various side projects.
Some files will be datasets and some will be my actual code and notebooks.

Within this erpository you will find a variety of folders...

- Data Visualizations: Contains various data Viz reports and dashboards from a variety of platforms
- API's: Contains misc scripts and files that work with API's
- Machine Learning: Contains files written primarily in Python and implement a variety of machine learning techniques

Enjoy.
