# Data_Projects
A repository for a variety of data science projects and files

This repository serves as a sort of "catch-all" for my various side projects.
Some files will be datasets and some will be my actual code and notebooks.

Within this erpository you will find a variety of folders...

- Machine Learning: These projects were written primarily in Python and implement a variety of machine learning techniques
- R Projects: These projects are misc files from R Studio projects over the years

Enjoy.
